Description: 
    Execute Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and Latent Class Regression (LCR) by using Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA). This is explained in Ryoo, Park, and Kim (2019) <doi:10.1007/s41237-019-00084-6>.
    It estimates the parameters of latent class prevalence and item response probability in LCA with a single line comment. It also provides graphs of item response probabilities. In addition, the package enables to estimate the relationship between the prevalence and covariates.
